# The Lovely Programming Language

Lovely is a low-level systems programming language, designed to be used to create the Humble operating system.

## Contributing:

All language features are being developed live, on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kiahjh-dev); however, if you have any optimizations/enhancements/fixes you want to contribute, please feel free to open a PR! I'm not currently accepting PRs that add new features/functionality to the language, because this is a learning project and I'd like to give those things a shot myself.

You can see [the syntax](https://github.com/kiahjh/lovely/blob/master/syntax.lv) here.
